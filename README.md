Lumenocity is a wallet built for Android and iOS on the Stellar network.

## Features

In v1, the aim is to make a minimal viable product. There's a lot of features still coming, and this is step one, to first of all gauge interest and also to establish a solid platform for further development.

So here's what we've got:

 * Multiple accounts
 * Federation w/ the lumenocity.io server (you*lumenocity.io)
 * Setting up an inflation pool, with a few popular inflation pools built in for ease of use
 * Name your accounts so that they are easier to keep track of
 * Sending XLM to any other address, including federated ones
 * QR codes can be used to export your keys, send your address to a friend or to pay your friend

## Roadmap

This is a big project. I started this in February and the aim was to get an app in the app stores for the judging phase of the Build Challenge on March 15th. But here's a sampling of what's coming:

 * Push notifications for transactions to/from your accounts in the app
 * Complete support for all assets on StellarTerm - this means showing them but also the ability to send and receive them
 * Send funds to anyone via email - they will get an email prompting them to collect your sent assets
 * Integration with the contact list on the phone, allowing you to set Stellar addresses to them
